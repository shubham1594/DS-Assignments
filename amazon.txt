  Okay. So you have been seeing people display their Macbooks and you have always fancied owning one of those premium devices. Now, as Amazon offers this Macbook Air at a reduced price, you are getting tempted to buy this. STOP and consider what you get for the money you spend. Do not buy this if you think this adds some premiumness to your profile. It will not - because this device is next in line where support will be withdrawn by Apple. Resist temptation - because THAT is what Apple sells. The last reason to buy should be your feeling that it improves your profile. Apple users will smirk when they see you with an obsolete 'dinosaur' device as they display their latest toys.If you are a windows user - better go to some friend's Macbook and try some activities. MAC OS is great till you try to change something as puny as your mouse cursor!! You realise that you are stuck in the little cozy jail of Apple once you try anything non-standard. Try transferring data by a USB stick from your other laptop to this one .... you will need training. USB partitioning has to be only ExFAT - and evn if you do this partitioning on a MAC, chances are that Windows will not recognise the USB stick. If you are not a power user - this can be a real pain. Of course, you can pretend (like so many thousands of Apple users) that these do not matter. But hey - they do. A premium DELL or HP may be the best option for you. (Yes, I will first discourage you from buying this and then explain why I purchased this for myself)Know that you are giving up the option of buying RAM or SSD from the neighbouring shop to extend the device life. You wil depend on Apple and on Apple alone. Of course there are generic spares - but these too are more expensive than the DELL or HP spares. Once Apple pulls the plug of support, these spares may get even more expensive. In fact, hardware upgrade beyond increasing the SSD is very much a rare luxury. Thankfully, I have kept myself out of this snob-race that Apple peddles.If you are still reading - here are the good sides (why I purchased this in spite of what I wrote above)A Mac is a Mac is a Mac. So is this one. The hardware are perfectly matched and performance is always optimal. This laptop is for carrying along as a second laptop, alongside my official one, a DELL workhorse. MAcbook Air is lightweight and can run other operating systems. I use this to run Windows and Linux.The MAC OS is a very stable Operating system. Chances are that you will never face a single crash in your lifetime of using this Macbook Air. Windows is fragile (too many bugs and updates) and Linux is difficult (you need a little training). That's where the Macbook Air comes in Handy. With Parallels desktop, you can load Linux and Windows on Virtual Machines on the Mac. You can seamlessly go from one OS to another without rebooting. However, note that with 'parallels desktop' you are operating Windows and Linux from your little cell in the Apple jail. And be prepared to shell out a good amount to \"buy\" this software. It is possible to load linux differently so that it works outside the Apple shell. Quite a saving grace. Using BootCamp (through a dual bootng feature), you can take advantage of the multi-tasking power of Windows without the risk of getting blue screens or hanged functions. So overall that looks great.Now coming back to my rating... I run mostly Windows and Linux on this MAC. Happy with it because the hardware is great. I consider myself a power user - so I know that I can find alternatives for this if and when Apple pulls the plug of support (should be available for at least another year, and a certain period after that as Apple's support to \"obsolete\" devices). Hence a durability rating of 3 stars only !!That (above) is the truth laid bare. Please decide and buy at your own risk.~~ Buy this if you like the hardware (but know that DELL or HP would give a much better hardware at this price, and those will be upgradable and last much longer than this)~~ Buy this because you understand that this hardware is very stable and Mac OS can protect your windows as it works in the MAC Shell. Buy this because you can run Linux once Mac makes this obsolete.~~ Do not buy this if you feel it adds to your premium value. It will be a dinosaur soon and you will be left stranded. Think of the plight of iPhone 5, which was premium 24 months ago. People rushed and purchased their \"cheap iPhone\" around a year back. Today, they have no pride in showing off a device that is obsolete. Tomorrow, Apple will make it sluggish and they will be forced to upgrade.EDIT/ADD [02/12/2019]: If you plan to upgrade your SSD to 500GB, please look at SSD (ASIN:B07J2WBKXF) with adapter (ASIN: B07D7VM8GM). I have been able to successfully upgrade myself. Review is on the SSD page.

  Finally a MacBook possession. Got it in 50k in Diwali sale. Technically good laptop.Good News.luxury product, niche technology, good battery life, reliable machine (other laptops crash and become defunct in 6-10 years), no anti-virus required, security of data and transactions much better. Terrific sense of possession & pride.Bad News. Problems will be there if you are switching from windows based system - very less space in hard disk, no CD drive, inability to transfer data from Mac to your existing external hard disc unless you format it, apps are mostly paid and re unreasonably expensive (no free apps which are available otherwise on google play store, even the angry bird costs Rs 400 !!), all printers are not compatible (e.g. the most economical MFD laser printer RICOH SP 111 can't be used), huge compatibility issues with Pages (MS Word) and Keynote (powerpoint) unless you master it by working on these (still mostly the document and slides either do not open in windows environment or have distortion issues). you need to spend extra for an external CD writer and tp buy a carry bag. Mac con not be connected to most of the projectors unless you buy some connectors, which are expensive and theres no clarity which one to buy and from where. you can't connect it to your TV, the ports are different and again theres no clarity - customer support, manuals or help section are silent ! Marketing strategy for Indian market, if at all has been planned, has been very bad. If these critical issues (and a few more not mentioned here) are handled properly, the Mac can sweep away other laptops in India. Presently, it doesn't seem to be happening.Overall Verdict.If compatibility issues mentioned above do not bother you, go for it. Else, think hard.  If its an emotional issue to own a long cherished Mac, then its a different thing. Go ahead and gradually you would figure out most (but not all) of the above problems, like I did.

  Best Laptop under 60k. If you don't want any accounting softwares like tally or busy then go for it, better than windows in every term. I just love it's battery life with sleek look <U+0001F60D>Now talking about MS officeIt's available on app store, free for 1 monthAfter that you will have to pay.You cannot install pirated version but if you install Windows 7 or any other version then u can use Ms office for freeBut in MacBook there are other apps which are good substitute for Ms office appsNumbers for ExcelPages for wordKeynote for PowerPointAnd you can convert your numbers file to Excel file or csv fileSame for the pages & keynoteSo no need of Ms office for me.Cons1. U cannot play games, your laptop will just heat up, battery will drain* U cannot play pubg mobile on emulator if you are pubg lover<U+0001F601>2. Storage 128gb, it will work fine but if you want to store movies or TV shows u can't, u have to buy external hard disk

  I am very upset about the product as I checked my MacBook 15 days back in December, it didn’t start. It was luckily in warranty . I took it to the service centre and they informed me the mother board and battery collapsed. If it was not in warranty I had to pay 47000/. I asked for replacement of the product and I was refused. They got it fixed for me. I don’t know why should I pay 57000/ for Mac quality. If this is the quality and the service, then I have to go to other product. In January my product expiry was due. They have give an extension of 3 months warranty when I had asked for 1 year. Very disappointed.

Apple service centre says they can’t fix the product under warranty and amazon in try to come up with a solution ever since , no solid answer . I m stuck with a dead mac after using it for 10days. Request seller , Amazon or apple to take full responsibility.

  I have been a Macbook pro user for last 2 years. I came across the new Macbook air and got a chance to put hands on it. So here is a brief review on my first impressions. Basically i will be comparing this with a regular laptop of similar price range and Macbook PROAir benefits compared to Non Apple laptop:# Slim and light weight for daily travel# 10-11 hours battery backup on normal usage# Apple touch pads are awesome, smooth and responsive compared to any premium laptop# Audio quality on speakers is good, but not as loud as my Macbook Pro 13# Apple front camera works the best in low light, best for low light skype calls# SSD - Apps launch very fast despite the low power processor# Metal body construction# Mag safe charger- If you are really careless this helps very much.# Ambient light sensor that adjusts brightness automatically ( Many people are not aware of this feature)# Keep your Air closed or leave somewhere idle and check back after 2 or 3 days, you will see battery has dropped less than 3 or 4 %# The best part - Mac OS, contains all that you need, a neat calendar, Todos app, notes, Quicktime, Mail app etc. Hassle free OSAir demerits compared to Non Apple laptop:# Performance is on lower side# Good for basic usage only, internet, movies, video calls, spreadsheets, mail# You will get better display(Full HD) if you buy a 999$ Ultrabook from US (In India they come at premium)Should you consider Macbook PRO? - PRO advantagesI know a lot of people might be confused whether to go with PRO for some additional bucks. So listing benefits of pro from my experience# Force touch - More comfortable touch pad, less finger pain compared to buttons on Air, Adjustable pressure# Retina display - More pixels, Better viewing angle. Air is 1440x900 while PRO is 2560x1600 pixels# Better performance - Pro CPU is actually about 50% faster than AIR, but in real world tests, apps launch at similar speed in both PRO and Air. The difference is notable only when you run CPU intensive tasks like Programming, Video encoding, Photo editing, Raw conversion etc. Those who are not into this can go with Air and save some money.# Newer CPU - Macbook air has not evolved much compared to PRO. The 2017 Air uses the same fifth generation CPU as the previous version (2015). But with a little upgrade in CPU speed. ie 1.6 GHz to 1.8 GHz. The newer PROs come with 7th generation Intel processors. The difference is mainly with the energy consumption.# HDMI port - You don't need display port adaptor# New keyboard - The 2016 PRO has the same keyboard as the \"Macbook\". Keys are less deeper and more wider. This makes it little more comfortable to type. Air comes with the same old keyboard as 2015 PRO# Wider touch pad - Not a big deal. But if someone loves that, its a bonus# Color options - Yes, Air is only available in Silver, PRO comes in 3 color optionsIf you think, all the above justifies the price difference between the PRO and Air, go for the PRO. The only benefit that Air offers is battery life. PRO offers 8-9 hours only, while Air offers, 11-12 hours battery.Whom Air is for?Macbook air is not a gaming machine or for hard core users. Its for people who love to watch lot of movies, work on documents, browse and some basic programming. When i say programming, Xcode works fine on Macbook air. But Software like Android studio, Photoshop seems to struggle a little on Air. But if you are once in a while user of intensive apps, you can ignore this.I will update my review with more details after a few weeks of hands on testing and usage. If you have any queries leave a comment below. I will try to answer in a day or two.Thanks for reading! Hope this helps.Also, Get 10% Cashback by Ordering through vqr .in/24

  Hi, Think thousand time before buying. One calm night i was cuddling in jaipuri blanket while enjoying youtube on this expensive machine. Cold night and little excitement created electrostatic charge which spike though spaceBar button. that's how it went to deep sleep forever. Nothing can bring it back and i am in no mood in spending another fortune on this machine. Apple, of you (i)care, this is the least of security feature included in all electronic devices. And the best part, it was a week after Warranty expiration date.

  Never purchase any Apple products. I bought 3 and start giving problems just after 6 months. I need to visit 4 times service station which is far 12 km. Again MacBook start acting dead after 6 more months. Mean a top priced laptop giving problems in every 6 months.I have good experiences with other brands of laptops. I hope this comment can help to save somebody’s money.

  Reason for 1 star is I ot an defective piece. The sound quality was not good . My laptop started giving issues with power button from  4 months. The screen would flicker and it would shutdown automatically after sometime. Took the mac to service centre. They replaced the motherboard free of cost as it was in warranty. Now my mac is perfectly fine :

  I bought MacBook air in 2017, it was working fine till last month. It suddenly stopped charging I took it apple care and was shocked to hear the feedback. They told me that the motherboard is dead and i have to buy a new motherboard. The cost was 50k ( i bought at 53k in 2017). We buy Apple products because they are meant to be long-lasting. I am really disappointed and would prefer other companies next time. They earn extra money from selling an extended warranty.

  I bought it last year from Amazon during Sale. It worked well for on year and then suddenly stopped working. I am unable to switch it on. I took it to service centre and they told that the logic board has to be replaced. The cost is around 45000. I am helpless. I dont want to invest more into that. I used the laptop very carefully but I think Amazon sent a defected piece on sale.

  Bought this MacBook for 51K in 2018 and 2 weeks back my laptop stopped working without the adaptor even at 100% I went to the Apple Store and they informed me that the logic board had corrosion and it would cost me 42K to get it replaced. Just after my warranty of a year expired, this issue came up. Highly not recommended. This was a defective piece and very conveniently Amazon/Apple sold a product that would last more than a year (the warranty) time just to have customers pay almost just as much to fix the laptop. I was major fan of Apple and its products but now I am really disheartened. I hate what happened. Cannot spend a dime on any Apple product ever again. PLEASE read this review before buying the product. Amazon/Apple PLEASE SELL BETTER PRODUCTS AND DO NOT PLAY WITH CUSTOMERS AND THEIR MONEY

  Got the Apple Macbook air on amazon discount sale.1) The OS is smooth and is a breeze to work with. Ships with macOS sierra but update is available to macOS mojave2) The design and build quality, as you can expect from an apple product is top notch.3) Excellen sound quality, keyboard.Cons:1) 128GB may be low incase you want to have movies and media in your laptop.You need to carry around a hard disk that kind of nullifies the advantage of having a light weight laptop.2) Display resolution is not exactly upto the mark

  Bought it on 9th July, stopped working / not turning power on by 4th Nov. Adding to this disappointment is - Apple's refusal to repair it under warranty stating that there is corrosion in Logic Board. Amazon also did not help. The seller - Appario - does not like to be bothered with it. Sometimes I wonder if buying electronics online is a good idea!

  Apple,apple,apple, thats the first thing that must have flashed in you mind when you saw this product, so here i have a total breif review on the laptop...***Pros***4k Video Editing with Final Cut Pro X on this thing works like butter, there is heating issue that i am going to go to apple service center to get it checkedEveryday works like checking mail and is just gr8The Battery is just OVERPOWERED, works for around 11-12 hours on continuous work and 8-9 hours when editingThe graphics card scores 30 fps in cinebench which is not that badThe performance is also fine, 280 cb processor score on cinebenchSpeakers are really good with perfect bass, its a laptop speaker, dont expect much from itDisplay brightness is 300 nits, which is fineThe Wi-Fi is extremely good, can get a network even from the living room while the router is in the bedroomVery thin and lightweightMacOS is good for School work if you know all the office applications for mac, for eg.Pages is WordMagSafe 2 is the best partGood Trackpad and Keyboard with backlightThe Storage is fast!, thanks to the M.2 based SSD!***Cons***Display, though the resolution is ok for a 13.3 inch display, the viewing angle is not appropriate for a 84k laptopGets heated up (Going to get it checked by apple support). Cooling not appropriate for this cpu, need a better thermal paste and fanRam management on MacOS Mojave is not good, 8 GBs of memory is not well distributed among all tasks running in backgroundMacOS is not made for gaming, you need to boot camp on this mac with Windows if you are really a hard-core gamerIntel HD integrated graphics at the price???, god damn it apple (Though its not bad, have seen GeForce 940MX at the same price)No Force trackpadBezels are way too thick in today's standardsNo thunderbolt 3 or Usb CCan't detect Android Devices until Android Device Explorer is installedThe Storage is less! (128 GB, will upgrade to 256 GB in a few years)***My Verdict***This devices is for them who want Battery and Power, and people who want to do Video Editing on Final Cut Pro X, if anyone has a heat up issue than you should Call apple Support and visit one service center immediately to get your laptop checked! Though the graphics is OK from my view, apple could have given better graphics like the radeon vega 8 graphics or Intel Iris Plus or Pro for a laptop that is so expensive! Everything else is Great! And MacOS is not that hard, i easily use both my Lenovo Gaming PC and my apple macbook air easily! Go for it if you are in the criteria I explained above! For hard-core video editing I would recommend atleast an iMac 4k or MacBook Pro Base Model because of its cooling Fan structure, Better Graphics and CPU! This Air is still not enough to edit 4k60fps videos! While exporting the 4k60fps video the CPU and GPU went up to 104 degrees, this is the reason i am going to apple support! Thank You if you read the whole review because I spent a lot of time writing this!*Update on 8 Oct, 2019*Apple service did nothing, so I thought of doing my own service! Yes, I changed the thermal paste and dusted the fan, now, everything is running even better than ever, even the heating issua is solved! Now while exporting a 4k 60 fps video, it's just around 80 degrees, hence no thermal throttling, Yay!

  For a full year until the warranty was valid, this MacBook Air worked like a charm. Then it died. No response to power button. No internal mechanical movement. The laptop is just dead. I gave it for repair at an Apple authorized service center and they told me it was a failed Power Section and IC. I paid Rs. 13,300 for replacement and service charge of these parts only for the laptop to run fine for a couple of days and then die out in th same way. The dealer says I would have to pay the same amount to get the parts replaced again with no guarantees that the issue won't turn up again. Never trusting an Apple product again. For such a rich money hogging brand, they offer the shoddiest quality of service and products ever.

  Was shocked to received a defective Apple MacBook. The device was not booting. Amazon was prompt in sending service Engineer, who certified the item defective. This item was replaced with a brand new MacBook as per Amazon policy. However to my dismay, this new MacBook also had a similar defect, which was again certified by the service Engineer. Apple is the world leader in laptops, and what amazes me is the 'QC' or the lack of it.Finally I had to request Amazon to refund the amount, which they did.

  I bought it last year from Amazon during Sale. It  suddenly stopped working twice in span of 1.5 yrs. I am unable to switch it on. After three months of purchase, I took it to service centre and they told that the logic board has to be replaced. The cost is around 45000. Luckily it was in the warranty. Now again after a eight month of replacement, it's dead again. I am helpless. I dont want to invest more into that. I used the laptop very carefully but I think Amazon sent a defected piece on sale.

  My experience was little bitter in a sense that for my Mac, USB port is not working. Took my newly bought Mac to Apple Service centre. they have checked and come up with comment \"USB port is not working\". However I believe they might have tried all possible option of software upgrade, iTunes upgrade etc, cable shuffle to work out but nothing works well. so Returning this machine and looking after replacing it with correct one.

  I purchased this product in February 2018 from Amazon. The power button started giving problems in end-May 2019. The computer just would not startup. I scanned the Net for such problems.  A lot of work arounds: push the Start button+ shift button etc. This worked for a few days. Then such work around too stopped working at all - the computed refused to start-up once shut down. Surprisingly, I ran the computer diagnostics on the Macbook, and the diagnostics program could not find any defect! I was surprised that even if the program could not find a defect on the computer, yet the computer once shut down would not start up.Secondly, finding a  Macbook authorised service center too is an onerous task in India. The Service center informed me that there is a problem with the mother board. And it needs to be replaced. Wow! Next time I would stick to my windows notebook, would never purchase a Macbook again!

  I am writing this review after 3 yrs. It was a great feeling when I purchased this laptop and it was a big ambition too... Why it can't be? People were looking at me with a great look when I carry this Mac along with me to office or to public places. It was again a great experience of speed, look, weight, logo, and u name anything u want, u have it...However, after 3 years, the problem suddenly came up. My Keypad and Mouse tracker both failed working and the reason was not known. I tried with customer care too to find a solution, however after spending an hr, I found no solution. Finally the CC suggested me to take it to Service centre. The CC person informed me that they will do resetting the mac but all in vain. For that they charged Rs.1800/-Then after 2 days they told that keypad need to be replaced which will cost Rs.25000/- then again for the Trackpad which will be around Rs.10000/-So totally it is Rs.35000/- (approx)Now the people whoever are reading this review, need to calculate there financial issues and then plan to go ahead. Moreover, I felt it is not so user friendly laptop and it has many restrictions. Eg-Connect Android Mobile to Mac...The cost of Display will be Rs. 49000/-.. Just think about it and then go ahead.Suggestion: For those who are crazy of Apple like me but with financial issues, then my suggestion will be \"BIG NO\".If u have no financial problems then it is ur choice... But still I say to them \"why do u spend\" so much when u have other FHD options available with better specifications???

  Thanks to amazon for superb timeliness and hassle-free delivery. Original item received. Properly packed for safety and kudos to the exchange offer i got it in somewhat lesser price. Still there are a few things or two like the caps lock key is being non responsive sometimes which might not be amazon's fault but still..its amazon who is in between. Overall the product is good. I'm fully satisfied with the performance and battery life. It actually gives upto 12 hours of battery life while you do small modular works.

  Apple Products are usually good, perform well and noncomplicated. I bought this laptop in Sep 2017 through Amazon. Today, just over two years the thing is dead and Apple Support says pay Rs.50,000.00 to change the motherboard. I bought it for Rs.60,000.00.  No guesses for anyone whothinks whether it is worth repairing. The propriety thing with Apple just goes a little too much. I did contactApple support asking them to reconsider their warranty terms.They said \"just too bad\" or word to that effect. I am now reconsidering buying any of their products. Just too bad.... So there you are. anyone thinking of buying apple products keep in mind the huge costs.... not to forget the likely short life of \"great Products\". O

   There is nothing to dislike about this machine. I'm sold by her looks, sleek and grace. It is not user friendly specially because i've had my hands on the black laptops forever but i'm getting around. I purchased Apple MacBook last year in December and it's been a pretty awesome experience. I love the MacOS applications. The keyboard is a delight to work in the dark. I have no issues with the sound quality! As a single user machine ,she never disappoints. Battery life is as mentioned. But to be very honest , I bought this machine because it adds to my collection of awesome gadgets. And I bought it because I could, I am so grateful! I love Apple products. They make for good show off, they look unique and stand out. This machine has been one of my best investments and technology acquired. So proud of her.

  The sheer fluidic response on this machine is simply awesome. Totally worth every penny.Even though I use Windows in my office for programming but this machine is a beast when it comes to performance. Zero lag, super fast reboot. Got it at a good deal for 47k.

  Very disappointed by the product quality. After carefully using for 2 years my device stared giving me problem. As soon as welcome screen appears and I key in my credentials screen turns to green and lines all over it.  When I contacted Icare they charged 1990 rs as diagnosis charge and after diagnosis, they sent me mail that \"Checked and Found device is not powering on. Did SMC, PRAM and checked with known good power adapter - Still same issue, Checked internal condition - found liquid damage and corrosion marks on logic board. Hence Logic board need to replace the logic board under exchange price to check further. customer denied service .\"  and overall repair charge was 48950 rs. Which is more than the cost of the laptop (44k when I purchased it.) and battery charge 12k separately

  Writing the review after a two yr usage of macbook. Bought it because of very good experience with other apple product. But this was pathetic. Within a year of use the screen had vertical colorful lines. Luckily it was under warranty and got it mended.Exactly after another yr i faced the same issue and cost of repair is only 42k.Very disappointed and people shld be aware of this issue before purchasing.Would not recommend to anyone.

  Don't buy for the pride or quality advertised. The lapot keyboard failed just 2 days after the warrenty period. Service cost was 19,000. So I backed out and was using a USB keyboard. Now the whole system is not switching On. Took to local service center it has costed me 3,500 to just make it work again and still will cost more to make the keyboard replaced. Truly gutted. I have my HP laptop pro book almost 9 years old still running without any issues. Was planning to buy an IPhone but surely not after this. Deeply sad by the experience.

  I purchased this for my mother, she is a prolific writer / poet and spends a ton of time on computers these days as a result. She has had fairly bad experiences with build quality, frequent hardware issues with other brands in the past and so wanted a good sturdy sleak laptop, this was a perfect  fit for her, especially now that the price was reasonably low and discounted, it was a no-brainer.

  well I have been using a windows laptop in the premium category for quiet some time.most of my time was spent dealing with driver issues with oem manufacturers, colossal problem with heating, os stutter in a 16 gb ram machine.i decide the pros and cons and again switched back to MacBook Air .1)the trackpad works like a dream.not like horrible windows with lag and stutter.multi gesture is a dream2) admittedly the display is not hd.but trust me much better than the much touted hd displays of horrific windows laptops I have used.in the same price range3)I am not a video editor but I am sure high end editing on 4k etc will be a challenge.but routine like image editing etc will be not an issue.if vfx pro etc is your daily grime look the Mac book pro4)routine work is a breeze..like..so cool the intuitive..experience...more so if you are in to the experience of apple ecosystem..airdrop etc...is very easy to comprehend5)the built quality and the battery is simply superb.here the low res display helps in easily 10-11 hours of usage.and 2 weeks of standby6)it is lighter and slimmer even than the new MacBook Air.7)no other MacBook has the glowing apple logo if it means much to you.maybe a collectible later:-)8)daily tasks are a breeze..however high end gaming will take a hit..tip:try and go for the extended warranty...at an apple store/apple protection plan

From past 1 week I am not able to turn on my mac, went to apple store and after troubleshooting they said it is having motherboard problem and need to replace which cost 50k, I was shocked and said how come in less than 2 year mac will have this issue. So kindly please beawre on this big bug mac air.

  Pros:Build: Metal material so still looks modern and rich.LightweightExcellent battery life (around 8-9hrs)Backlit keyboard(although all macbooks have it)OS. (Smooth Lagfree)Apple icloud storage: 1$/75Rs. a Month for 50GB of cloud storage.( Not an advantage but You will need this if you typically store photos, videos)Keyboard: excellant keyboard with haptic feedback keys.Cons:Display: 720p display. But its still pretty cool!Processor is bit old but it still runs efficiently.Storage: 128GB SSD will only leave you with 85GB of free space.( I suggest you invest 75Rs/Month and get extra 50GB icloud storage which works seamlessly)

  After using almost 6 months I am sharing my review, I suggest to not buy this at all because after purchase within 10 days it's gave me shock while charging, after many followups finally they replaced with new laptop, I am quite happy that time but again same issue after 1 month, within 6 months I went to service center 2 times, Again I need to go 3rd time, That keys not work properly after some days and battery also not great, And worst gaming experience because its provide too much heat, We can't even use 30 min, Worst experience with Apple and work experience with amazon agents No one give customer satisfaction after purchasing

  its been 2 years since I bought this and never has it ever crashed on me.it works seamlessly with my AirPods, and iPhone, keeps my iCloud photos unto date instantlythe battery life is off the charts. I've been using it regularly for financial modelling, python for finance, movies, Apple Music, and even mild gaming, it has never disappointed me.as a student, I've used a windows pc too, but honestly, those have never lasted me too long without repair.ive always had to either do an over haul, or install some antivirus, but never for this MacBook.during covid times, in fact it has over performed, I never knew id rely so much on video conferencing, and the camera in this thing, is worlds better than others I have used that may even have better specs.sure, apple can eventually scrap updates for it, but to be honest I don't think it will, I just upgraded it to the new macOS Catalina and it's even smoother than everthe most important thing is honestly the build. everyone says Macs are delicate, but that's a huge farce. I carry this thing around all over, to work, to college, on flights, because its so light I end up carrying it around much too often. but as compared to my windows laptops, this one barely has any wear and tear. off I take care of it, I make sure I don't rough handle it, but I did the same with my older laptops, however they always ended up with buff marks or scratches.not too sure if my review really helps, but this is more of a rant about how good this laptop has been to me, and how much I rely on it.haha, cheers

  I have been a Macbook pro user for last 2 years. I came across the new Macbook air and got a chance to put hands on it. So here is a brief review on my first impressions. Basically i will be comparing this with a regular laptop of similar price range and Macbook PROAir benefits compared to Non Apple laptop:# Slim and light weight for daily travel# 10-11 hours battery backup on normal usage# Apple touch pads are awesome, smooth and responsive compared to any premium laptop# Audio quality on speakers is good, but not as loud as my Macbook Pro 13# Apple front camera works the best in low light, best for low light skype calls# SSD - Apps launch very fast despite the low power processor# Metal body construction# Mag safe charger- If you are really careless this helps very much.# Ambient light sensor that adjusts brightness automatically ( Many people are not aware of this feature)# Keep your Air closed or leave somewhere idle and check back after 2 or 3 days, you will see battery has dropped less than 3 or 4 %# The best part - Mac OS, contains all that you need, a neat calendar, Todos app, notes, Quicktime, Mail app etc. Hassle free OSAir demerits compared to Non Apple laptop:Air demerits compared to Non Apple laptop:# Performance is on lower side# Good for basic usage only, internet, movies, video calls, spreadsheets, mail# You will get better display(Full HD) if you buy a 999$ Ultrabook from US (In India they come at premium)Should you consider Macbook PRO? - PRO advantagesI know a lot of people might be confused whether to go with PRO for some additional bucks. So listing benefits of pro from my experience

  I got this for 52K during Amazon Sale. I can say that this is the best budget friendly Macbook ever.I have been a windows user for a very long time and always wanted to try a Mac because the whole world uses it. I used to be an Apple critic. But after using it for months, I can say that I am never going back to Windows again.The only thing Windows does better is gaming. Buy a Windows if you care about gaming. For everything else, Mac should be your preference. If you are looking forward to developing iOS or Mac apps, Mac is the only way.It is much more faster, responsive and sturdy than my Windows laptop. The OS never crashes and the performance is just flawless. Meanwhile my Windows laptop crashes very often ( Blue screen of death, Unwanted updates, driver incompatibility etc). I receive free OS updates every now and then and there has never been a compatibility issue.Apple - You just earned a new customer for life. Just make sure you don’t keep increasing the prices as it is the only con I can think of.TL;DR - If you want a laptop that is not going to irritate you every now and then and your budget is 50-60K. Wait for the sale and go for this Mac. But remember - This is not for gaming. For that, buy windows

  Purchased in July2018. After 2 years of good usage, its working same as when I bought it (processor basically). LOVE the trackpad and the keys!Things that changed after 2 years are that it starts heating up near the charging point (even when I'm not charging and simply using it) sometimes (3/10 times). I searched and found out it happens due to dirt particles going inside and can be resolved by going to a store and ask them to fix or buy a set of screwdriver for this mac and clean it up yourself.Another problem is the adapter, now after 2 years it had started heating up A LOT (7/10 times). Sometimes you can't even touch it for more than 5 seconds, it gets that hot. So for that what I do is use charger with its extension, put the adapter on the floor to transfer the heat (lol). It works most of the times for me, sometimes it doesn't and I have to take the magsafe connector off the laptop every few minutes (if I'm using the laptop) .The MagSafe connector also gets very hot while charging but cools down in literally 4-5 seconds after disconnecting.Third problem I saw is with Charging wire (from near the MagSafe connector), it's started to turn yellow due to heat probably. I put of a cable protector 2 months ago and saw this 'development' happening after that only mostly.  I took that protector off now.Overall it's a very good machine.  My friend who has the same model replaced the battery after 3+ years usage and now his laptop is working perfectly fine. He doesn't face heating problems much as I do. So maybe my laptop got some defects.I haven't tried other laptops in this range except Lenovo Yoga which was BS. I remember struggling to find internet and bluetooth connectivity in windows laptop, in Mac everything is so smooth. It doesn't hang at all! And yes not to forget, it's lightweight!! I think this is one the best machines in this price range. Go for it.

  My MacBook logic board dead with 8 months...apple replaced my logic board and fixed my laptop. But within a year the logic board is dead again and cost of repairing the same is 40k+Plz don't buy it if you cannot afford to repair the same. Not sure what to do with my MacBook Air....it cost more to repair than a decent windows laptop.I will never buy any apple product in future...the cost to repair are extremely very high..

  I was a big Fan of Apple products and have been using the same for past 8 years. However the recent incident with my Mac Air that I brought through Amazon last October changes the perception towards Apple took a deep dent.Few months ago I had some issue with my MacAir screen, there was no accidental fall or mishandling on my part, which is quite evident as there are no physical damage not even a scratch which says that there was any mishandling on my part.At the time it was still under warranty period, So I took it to one of the Authorized apple store nearby, At the service centre the technician just by looking at the screen told me that it won’t be covered under warranty and I’ve to pay  Rs. 43,000/- towards replacement, which came as a shock to me as, first there was no fault of my own, and secondly the whole thing cost me Rs. 54,000/- so I don’t know how Apple justify such unfair pricing. Thereafter, shocked and helpless I follow up with Apple Support repeated calls and chatting but all in vain, but apparently I found out that there is nothing on their hand, whatever the Authorized Apple Service center says is the final. I was told it is pressure damage, which won’t be covered under warranty and will cost me as much the cost of Original Machine. I was unaware and shock to find that Organization like Apple will indulge in such fraudulent and unfair trade practice for unfair monetary gain.When I look for more information online it came to my knowledge that this is not an uncommon thing with MacAir, it so fragile that MacAir is prone to pressure damage, a designing and manufacturing flaw, and there are many users who has suffered the same, and Apple has refused to address.Currently my Mac is unusable and just like that without any fault of my own my entire saving of Rs 54,000/- gone to waste. There is no question of repairing at an unjustified cost when few thousands more will get me a new one and there are better options avalible other than Mac .Pro: Atheistic, premium feelingCons: Shocking replacement cost,  Poor Post sale Support, Fragile and prone to screen damage

  I bought this at end of November 2019.It worked good for 7 months till June 2020 and then screen started blinking.I went to Apple store for repair. They took 3 weeks to repair it. They repaired screen but battery life came to 3-4 hours which earlier was 10-11 hours and the usage was same. Also the fan sometimes automatically started running very fast and automatically stopped. Even switching ON after shut down, the fan started to run fast.When I brought back after repair, the charger got damaged after 4 days and I took MacBook as well as charger for repair. They exchanged the charger with the new one which doesn't look like Apple original, as when I plug in the charger, I get small amount of current over my MacBook.And they inspected MacBook and did something and said that Fan issue has been solved.After 1 week I'm still getting same Fan issues and the battery life has literally fallen a lot as compared to before the repair.So there is one year warranty for this, and I spent 3 months of it only in repair. And the problems started arising after 1st screen repair.It seems they knowingly put these so that you have to buy 2 year extra warranty.Everything started only after when I took my MacBook to repair.

  I newly switched to Mac OS and this MacBook Air 13\" model is best for those who are thinking to move from Windows to Mac OS, Good Battery Life, Comfortable, Very Slim. Apple MacBook Air provides much more features than the ordinary windows Laptop. Working on MacBook is very easy and lots of your time and efforts are reduced. I will not recommend MacBook for Gaming because this Device is meant for Professional Work.Purchasing an external hard disk would be the best option for those who has complaint about 128GB HDD.

  I purchased this mac 2 years back during sale and I absolutely love it. I was on Team Windows for many many years and have used HP, lenovo, Dell and Acer laptops in the past. I was told multiple tales about the difficulties of using a mac interface after being a windows user. Please do not be disuaded by all this and give it a try. I barely takes a week to get accustomed to everything.PROS:1. This is the best for daily/work use due to its battery life. It works seamlessly for over 12 to 15hours without plugging in a wall charger2. The laptop is seriously light weight which makes it easy to use on the go3. Gets all new software updates released by apple4. The windows based laptops from the companies mentioned above start ageing but 1.5year mark. Slower speed, diminishing battery life, hardware and software issues. None of the usual crap is seen with a mac. My 2 year old mac has the same functionality like the day of its purchase.5. Good for video editing6. Keyboard is great7. Best mouse tracker overallCONS:1. Apple laptops are expensive so I recommend waiting for sale to purchase one. It is also an investment for next 5 to 6 years for seamless laptop use. Buy only if you are going to get a good use out of it.2. The screen quality of this model( aka older version) is not the best. Newer models have a significantly better display. If you have the money, go for it.3. This is not a gaming laptop. If you are looking for that, this is not for you.Overall impression:I dont think a mac should be purchased to be a status symbol or by brand fanatics.If you are a student or someone who requires a mid range laptop, I would recommend this.For people with bigger pockets, I would recommend the new macbook air. The screen quality is excellent and the laptop is much faster than its contemporaries.

  Stopped working after 1 year and 2 months, just died for no reason.What the hell, such horrible customer support. Straightaway charging 3.5 K for diagnosis and 43 K for motherboard replacement that too for a fault that is on their end (their hardware).Feels like the most illogical thing I have ever faced. Hugely disappointed in Apple.Product is amazing as long as you don't face such issue. however, if you try to search videos on youtube youtube, you will see tens of thousands of views on videos related sudden death of Macbook air, which proves that this is a very common problem and seems like Apple customer support has only one  solution for all their hardware problems, replace the motherboard. What the hell!!! How are we expected to trust Apple products?

  I was very confused on buying Mac Air over other Gaming laptops which offered better specs. But somehow it made sense over the time. I am writing this review after 1 year of usage. I bought the Mac Air (2017 version) on Jan 2019 for around 61K.Experience:About 121 GB will be available for your usage. System is super speed and responsive. Absolutely seamless performance. Display is a beauty. I know some would complain about its viewing angle, but when you start to use it, no one will care about such technical details. Its the most lightest and slimmest machine, don't worry weight. The best part is, Battery Backup. Its so long that you'll even forget when was it last charged. Even on straight usage, minimum 8 hours is guaranteed. I think its more than that.If you are a software developer, trust me, it will perform way more than any other i5+8GB machine, plus you get the Linux flavor.But.......1) Don't buy if you are gamer. Please don't buy. This is not meant for that.2) Don't buy if you are a big fan of windows and use too many 'unpopular' software. Although Mac OS will support all enterprise level and popular software, you will not find software for every crappy thing.3) If you are a careless user of laptop, like smashing keyboard and dropping laptop kinda guy/girl. Mac is somewhat sensitive and cannot withstand your strong emotional outbursts.4) Don't buy if you need a dedicated Graphics card or high performance systems. Like for Data Analysis, Machine Learning (Basic stuffs can be done though), computational chemistry or too heavy stuff like that.My advice:More than the specs, Seek a machine that seeks you.

  Be careful while buying electronic products through Amazon.I bought this macbook for 56k on March 2018. After 1.5 years of usage, the display stopped working for no reason. The device never had any accidental drop or shock while I was using it through these years. The service center guy told me it would cost around 41k for screen replacement. Now I'm left with no option.If you are buying, I suggest you to buy it along with a protection plan or any extended warranty.

  I have been a Mac user for more than a decade now and a Mac Book Air user for about 6 years in that time. Deeply disappointed in this purchase. The camera does not function. Unfortunately for me, I did not use camera for all these months (I am more of a zoom/skype from my phone person) and realized this glitch only about a month back. Have already spoken with Customer Care at Apple and they have also confirmed that my camera indeed does not work and advised me to take the laptop to local apple store. That surely isn't happening now owing to the lockdown that we are all currently in.

  I am a Music producer and I am writing this review after 2 years of usage of my MacBook Air 13 inches. When I received the Laptop, I had to face a few software issues but when I updated my Operating system, those issues got fixed. It would be a greater laptop for those who knows what it does. Apple is not for everyone and not for simple use. If you know what you are doing and know what you want, then MacBook Air is a best Laptop. It is way faster than my desktop at home that has 3.0GHz of processing speed whereas my Laptop offers only 1.8 GHz processing speed. This is a positive review and Music producers out there, I would highly recommend this Laptop for you that is of low price and amazing process.

  After using Windows Operating system for the past 10+ years, I switched to Mac. The switch was inspired by the awesome reviews I got from my friends. I must say that they were all real and that the device and the tech is so very impressive. Be it the design,  be it the processing speed, be it the battery life......all are way ahead than that of a Windows device. I am satisfied to get the marvel of a tech in my hands. It is saving my time every now and then as I am stricken with an idea to pen a couplet, short story or poem.....I simply open the lid, note the idea and then simply close it....no need of shutting the OS down everytime. Working perfectly.

  After two years of buying this dream, it became a nightmare when it just refused to power on. Took it to a service centre and I was told they had to replace the mother board for Rsm 46,000. Reading the reviews, I realize there are a whole lot of people who have faced the same problem like me. It is evident that defective pieces are being sold online. No more Mac priducts for me. I have learnt my lesson. However, if you still feel you must buy this product, please don't buy it online but pay it from a store.

  Pros -1) Looks  Splendid and amazing.2) Genuine Apple product and so light .3) Extremely Fast , can multi task.4) Above average battery / just shut the lid and open it anytime ( it will not buffer )5) if you have an I phone  , you can connect it and life is simpler and can sync everything.6) Go for it if you want to browse , watch videos and best if you are lazy/laid back as the Mac book air opens so quick and you can continue from where you left or if you wish to search something and would like to see an answer asap rather than waiting for your windows to open and buffer etc etc and lose interest ( been there done that :) )Cons1) storage is very less ( 128 gb)2) mostly for browsing and can do Usual ppt/excel office work .3) Big no for gaming and for heavy editing4) 2017 model

  Honestly, there's nothing like a Mac. It works so fast and so smooth.My work requires multiple windows each containing 20-40 tabs open at a time.Not once has it slowed down or lagged.I work really fast and keep switching tabs and apps and I have no issues.If you're working from home, this is definitely worth it. You don't have to wait for things to load.I've been using Mac since 2015 and I can't go back. I bought this one in Dec 2019 at Rs. 57000. Totally worth it.

  This seems to be a common problem for the MacBook sold by Amazon. Bought my MacBook Air from Amazon in Mar of 2019. Mac completely stopped working after a year and a half. Authorised service centre says Logic board is the problem and Apple recommends a the complete logic board to be replaced which costs Rs 35000/-. How illogical is that when Amazon is selling the MacBook Air at Rs.65000/-. The question is if Amazon is cheating us in India?

  I bought it with very high expectation, but its logic board got damaged in 1.5 years only. The repalcement charges for logic board is around 40500INR. I am very dissappointed with the product and I am switching back to windows.

  This MacBook is low on price and very nice to use. First of all, it's apple and the product is excellent. I have been an apple user bit never used a MacBook before. The quality is 1st class but in case of display if you look closely you can see pixels but not big of and issue. It is working nicely and fast but one thing is clear... *IT IS NOT FOR GAMING* games will lag but you can still play apple arcade or play games from browser... A thing is apps like netflix and ms teams, Pinterest, Spotify etc. U can not find in app store but you can get em from the web browser. Lemme tell u battery life is OUTSTANDING it litterally charges in 5 mins trust me and lasts long <U+270C><U+FE0F><U+0001F60B>Overall I'll give it 4 stars for display and games but if you are thinking to buy it, go for it don't think twice <U+0001F917> thank you for reading this and *GO FOR IT*

  Amazon delivering defected products amazon made delay in delivery of appx. 4days even after continue follow ups CC, they guys are also trained in giving fake/wrong information. After that it stop working automatically i visited Apple Store three time within 2 weeks of purchase it still not working properly. Even on twitter apple is not responding buying apple products is just wastage of money. Amazon n Apple this time made a best combination cause they proved these both are worst.

  The product is what it is you can refer to tons of websites which are much better for seeing laptop reviews and relevant as well. i would only refer to my amazon experience for this product. even after 5 days of delivery the product purchase is not verified with apple yet, meaning, i am unable to get any support from apple on anything while setting things up in my new laptop.  I tried following up with Amazon through email, call, chat and what not and they are easy to get to deliver an expensive item but difficult to get hold of for any follow up post sale.i am still following up with them to register my purchase with apple and my overall review rating is purely for Amazon and not for Apple.

  Everything was fine until one fateful day, the laptop decided not to work! When I checked with Apple service centre, they are telling logic board to be replaced and it costs 45k! Since I did not purchase any additional warranty, neither I cannot repair this nor cannot leave just like thatSurprisingly the fault happened after few months of 1year warranty with no sign of faulty behavior until that last day!If you are Apple Fan buy with additional warranty else buy some other laptop

  One of the worst product i have ever bought. The screen will get fade out after the end of the product warranty. You wouldn't have any option rather taking the laptop to service center. You would have to bear a huge cost for that.. around 15k to 25+k.. which means you need to buy a brand new laptop.In one word, \"Waste of Money\".

  Worst Laptop in the history of Mankind. Its has a scam software which makes it dead and when it reaches the recycler it becomes active after software rewriting. It is a SCAM by APPLE. Earlier cases have been reported in USA and apple have lost many cases in this regard. Overall Apple is FRAUD.

  Bought this during Diwali sale. Apple is amazing. I was confused between Dell/HP touchscreen laptops and Macbook. Then after going through every single detail, I must say this is very powerful machine. If you dont require so much softwares , then definitely go for it. Being a researcher and student, whatever i need is easily available through softonic or other websites. and it has good substitute of MS Office. Battery Back up is very good. I use it for 7-8 hours a day and normally it can be used for upto 15 hours.

  This is the worst  apple product I have ever seen ...6 month After purchase of this fake book ...some of its keys of keyboard  stopped working ...So the service center  replace my keyboard with the new one ...But after some months with  the new replaced  keyboard some of its key again stopped working .All these things happen in one year and 3 month timeline which is roughly 1.5 years of original purchase date ... ...When I spoke to the service center they told me that the warranty is over you need to pay 12000 rs ...So I don't have any option. The cost is too high. ..So now I m working with the external keyboard which cost me merely 200 rs ... My friend bought the same macbook from the showroom and i must say its really working good and it doesnt show any fault at all .Till now .i wish i also bought this macbook from the showroom ....

  Very handy laptop, light weight and portable. Mac OS is super cool. Battery backup was good. Defective product recieved,within 2 months of use, laptop gets switched off suddenly while on battery. Requires power input to restart again.Contacted service centre, they told its motherboard problem and replaced motherboard under warranty, but problem still persisting. Laptop still at service center. Earlier i was using toshiba laptop, satellite 340,lasted 8 yrs without any problem. Paid a premium for macbook air very dissapointed with apple quality of products. And to repair it outside warranty, parts cost as much as the laptop itself<U+0001F644>

  I was looking for an affordable long lasting light laptop and my search led me to this. I know Apple has launch a new Air but this is still a good performer and with the recent price cut this laptop makes so much sense. I was using MacBook Pro for last 8 years, and after it retired this replaced the Pro and is not doing a bad job at it at all.

  MacBook Air is excellent. The build is super strong, the operating systems runs smooth. The trackpad and keyboard are great. The only thing that can be improved is its screen (the visuals). Not as good as expected. The hard disk is too small but if you carry an external hard disk you can solve that problem. Got it at the price of a Dell Windows laptop during Amazon sale. A great deal.

  I shall never recommend To buy expensive Mac air laptops or Mac book on line. Just after one month of purchase, the screen disappeared. Not even switching on. It looks like the Delhi retailer played with it, disposing off a old model with defective piece. This fault should have happened in 15 days but happened after 30 days. So much disappointment beyond imagination.

  The macbook received has a faulty keyboard. The keys are taking wrong input. eg: on pressing @, the macbook is receiving \" as input. It's really irritating as there is no option to return or replace the product via Amazon. Please help ASAP. Its an expensive purchase and there is no support from Amazons end.

  General observation, Do not buy expensive electronics from Amazon as thy have no quality control in place/checks on their vendors. Mostly, vendors pass on defective items to customers. It is true across categories.

  I was apprehensive of buying Apple product from Amazon as some reviews suggested that imported items are being sold. However what I got was fresh and genuine product, I checked warranty on Apple site with serial no. All serial no - on bill, box, inner box and in macOS itself were consistent. Display is too good and it feels like butter operating the device. Only thing is that price difference between this and 256GB version is too much.

  Display and motherboard defective. Had a horrible time, tried applying for replacement. Couldn’t get it because amazon has a 7 day replacement warranty that I had missed. Please be careful when buying this machine. Make sure you check it thoroughly immediately and file a report even if you find a small issue. Screen flickering could be motherboard/display issue or both.Won’t recommend this laptop. And unfortunately I am stuck with it.

  The MacBook is good in-terms of what it is designed for. The laptop is light weight so no hassle while carrying during travels. The backlit keyboard is a good advantage to work in low light. The performance is good, I use it for game development and I have not faced any problems until now. The transition from Windows to Mac was easy, not much of a hassle, initial few days, to understand the shortcut keys and how to operate will be little bit slow, post that it is just a breeze. Many applications are supported, no issue in bluetooth or USB connectivity or WIFI connectivity.

  Disappointed as the MacBook came with a scratch , non laminated box, no sticker on the full body of the macbook and a scratch!!Moreover the charger refused to charge. Looks like a used item being sent. Even the instruction manuals were crumpled.Didn't feel like a new MacBook. Couldn't charge as the charger refused to turn on and charge.Now Amazon doesn't have an option for replacement! So returning <U+0001F621><U+0001F621>

  Ordered an Apple Mac Book Air. Utterly disappointed when we tried to set it up . The keys wouldn’t work. To say that it was shocking would not be further from the truth because when you order a high end product like this you don’t expect a defective piece which has scratches on it. While we wanted a refund, that was denied and a new piece was sent. For now it’s working fine but there’s always a doubt now. Really disappointed and let down by Amazon..
